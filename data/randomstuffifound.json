It's the one skill in life that benefits from ignoring what everyone else knows.", "Your family will always encourage you to play it safe rather than take risks. The reason is they share your pain of losing much more than they share in the fruits of your success.

It helps with job interviews, relationships, and hobbies.", "The only place you can go by following someone else's map is to a destination that's already been reached.

I wasted a lot of time and energy on putting out an idealized image of myself. It's impossible and exhausting. Surround yourself by smart people, and when you don't understand something, admit it and ask for help.", "Don't fall for the trap that your life needs to be one long narrative that you should be building. Life is best when it's a bunch of happy moments that just happen to be connected.Don't try to make your life into a novel, make it a book of poems. ", "A narrow focus brings big results.

But it's a series of small wins that can give us the most significant success.", "When dealing with conflict, always use the \"when you do/say X, it makes me feel Y because Z\" formula.

The inability to go through life without unintentionally hurting someone is the fatal flaw of our humanity. If I haven't let you down yet, just wait. We probably haven't known each other long enough.", "If you lose or forget to bring a cable, adapter or charger, check with your hotel. Most hotels now have a drawer full of cables, adapters and chargers others have left behind, and probably have the one you are missing. You can often claim it after borrowing it.", "If you want to do more than meet the expectations of society's life plan, come up with your own definition of success. This definition isn't just a series of boxes you check. It continually evolves because of the eternal gap between who we are and who we want to be.", "Rule of 7 in research.

If you are willing to go to the 7th source, you'll almost always get your answer.", "If you have to choose between increasing your rank or expanding your skills, choose the latter. At least this way, no matter what, you'll have the skills. An increase in rank is temporary. Expansion of skills is permanent. Rank can be taken away from you, your skills can't.", "Everyone wants their life to improve, but not everyone wants to improve their life. Therefore, don't help people who won't help themselves. There are too many people in this world who genuinely need help to waste your time with those unwilling to better their circumstances.", "Keep a journal. Your mind will adjust memories to make them consistent with your current circumstances. You'll want to look back and see what you thought was a big deal, what you believed and predicted. You can't imagine the value of consistently writing (which is thinking).", "Figuring out what you were born to do requires trial and error. This process is not linear despite that fact that we are educated to approach life in a linear fashion. If there's one commonality between the 700 plus people I've interviewed, it's that their path wasn't linear.", "Get to acceptance as fast as possible. By acceptance, I mean welcome everything that happens in your life. The best time to prepare for a crisis is before it comes. An overreaction is an indication you either didn't prepare or lack imagination [to think this couldn't happen].", "To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Nothing elevates a person higher than quickly admitting and taking personal responsibility for the mistakes you make and then fixing them fairly. If you mess up, fess up. It's astounding how powerful this ownership is.", "Everybody has something you don't. And you have something they don't.

But when he came to my 41st bday at my parent's house, he told me how lucky I was to be that close to my family.", "All advice is context-driven. It's based on one person's experience.

Set yourself up by not rushing into it. Your 20s and 30s are for accumulating experience: travel, date, read, argue, do drugs, see live music, volunteer. Every time you gain experience, your ceiling for a more rewarding rest of your life goes up.", "Spend time in other cultures as soon as possible. Not a small enclave within your own country i.e. Chinatown or Little Havana (although that's not a bad idea), But actually leave the US and stay a while. You need to know just how many of your beliefs and thought patterns are conditioning.", "You don't have to have kids and buy a minivan and live that life. It's totally fine if you don't. You might even be happier and a lot wealthier in the end. You're not weird or broken because you want to live a less \"normal\" life. A lot of us do it you just don't see us marketed to on TV. ", "Never fear failure - My biggest failures have been always the most life-changing. People like J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series got a constant rejection from publishers, Steve Jobs lost Apple, Oprah got fired at 23. Not all of those failures stopped them from being successful.", "True self-confidence is rare because it's hard to attain and there are no shortcuts 1) If and when you encounter unexpected hardship, you must endure it without alcohol or drugs 2) You'll develop an enthusiasm about yourself when you can force yourself to do things others aren't willing to do.", "It's hard to expand your horizons when your perspective is limited to one town, one country, one bubble. Some countries have traffic that makes crossing the street a near-death experience. If you spend your life in suburbia, you'll never learn to tolerate the stress of bigger and bolder things.", "Often, we lose what we have to make space for what we need. You lose a client, a girlfriend, or something else. Loss creates an opening in our lives. If we don't fill that space with panic and anxiety, whatever replaces what we lost will be better. It just won't ever seem that way in the moment.", "Look inside your soul and find your tools. We all have tools and have to live with the help of them. I have two tools: my words and my images. I used my typewriter, computer, and my cameras to fight injustice. Whenever I see a possibility of helping people who are in danger, I want to help them.", "Pay attention to how your body reacts to people & ideas. If muscles twitch or you feel energized, your body is telling you to take action. Conversely, if you hear or read something that drains your energy even slightly, reconsider. Your body is smart-don't underestimate its connection to the mind.", "Almost nothing is the catastrophe we make it out to be. I lost my sim card after buying a new one in India. When I sat down, I remembered Naval's advice about valuing your time. I could read and write for the next two hours or go searching for a sim card that I can't even use until 3 weeks from now.", "Never use a credit card for credit. The only kind of credit, or debt, that is acceptable is debt to acquire something whose exchange value is extremely likely to increase, like in a home. The exchange value of most things diminishes or vanishes the moment you purchase them. Don't be in debt to losers.", "I'm sure this will never get seen, but I haven't seen any comments about what I consider to be the most important things...Never stop learning, and don't be afraid to say \"I dont know\" to something you don't know. It's amazing what you can accomplish when you are inquisitive about the world around you. ", "Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don't know what you are passionate about.
