Hey 17 year old, Jobs and work culture are 100% bullshit. But make sure you get a job. I haven't had a job in 10 years, and it just sucks. I can't get disability and no one in their right mind would hire me. I'm lucky my husband takes care of us

Hey 37 year old, Stay up until the sun rises.  You used to do it in your teens and twenties, do it in your thirties.   Have a bonfire.   Stay at the bar until close.   Watch that big ball rise and know that you still got a little left in the tank

Hey 42 year old, Take care of your body...really take care of it. Start now if you need to and start small. Use lotion all over, take your vitamins, and take long walks.  Hold hands with your spouse and be silly. Don't stop dancing around the house
Hey 18 year old, If you live in the US or someplace with expensive colleges, think before you sign up for the student debt. College might not be as important as they make it look like, especially for tech. You can get into Google with bootcamps too
Hey 38 year old, think about buying a house with your partner? Think twice and talk, talk, talk  - about your relationship, about expectations. You make a few big decisions in your life, maybe kids, settling down. Talk now instead of divorce later!
Hey 19 year old, You don’t have to get married, go to college, have kids or do anything else on a set schedule. Your twenties and thirties are a longer stretch of time than you think. You are allowed to take some time and figure out your life goals
Hey 17 year old, As you look towards graduation from high school, realize that whatever decision you make doesn't have to be permanent. Just make a new decision. This doesn't mean it was wrong or bad. It just was. And now you can make a new decision
Hey 61 year old, What ever "they" tell you  to do  ....... forget that and do what you really really want  . The thing that makes your heart  happy.  It is your mistakes to make . Make them. Learn from them. Theres plenty of time to do all the  rest

Hey 14 year old, The most important truth is that no one magically knows what they are doing in life. Not kids, not teenagers, not adults. Not you. Be humble, but don't take any guff. We're all doing the best we can with what we have, including you!
Hey 13 year old, I know that maybe you feel that that specific person doesn't love you in the same way that you love them. But look around! Aren't you just being a little too distracted and too proud to realize that you're focused on the wrong side?
Hey 18 year old, Having crushes on people is normal. It feels like destiny, and feels like the end of the world when it goes wrong, but it really isn't. Watch your personal space, read about consent, then just chill out and enjoy having close friends
Hey 19 year old, If you're after advice, try to find a way to unlearn and rehear all the wisdom that has been shared with you thus far. It's an astonishing amount and it's easy to write off. The difficulty is to listen in a way so you can hear it new
Hey 13 year old, Never be afraid to ask for help. People are communal animals; we need each other. Thinking that you should be able to do it all yourself is self-defeating. You will need help. It’s nothing to be ashamed of, so don’t be ashamed to ask
Hey 17 year old, I know you're looking forward to being done with High school. If you're sure that you're going to college, go get a job in an office somewhere. It may be irrelevant to your education but it will teach you to approach school like a job
Hey 16 year old, don't worry about being cool in high school. All your close friends will be people after high school that actually share your interests. It's a training ground to make mistakes and be embarrassed, none of it will matter once you leave
Hey 19 year old, It's difficult to understand a parents love for their children until you have children of your own. All I can tell you is that it trancends anything you understand about love. And I assure you, your parents love you more than anything
Hey 13 year old, Don't fret. You still have the rest of your life to figure things out. You don't need to have everything figured out when you're that young. Not even when you're 18. Trust me, I'm 17 now, and I still don't entirely know what I'm doing
Hey 18 year old, Either you just graduated or you are about to. You are an adult now. Treat people as your equal and develop skills that will bring you a richer life. Don't feel bad about taking a gap year but seriously consider college. It's important
Hey 19 year old, Power through.  You're about to enter the next stage of your life.  Pain and trauma you've experienced to this point will start to mold the person you are, and how you treat people as you grow.  Value true relationships and friendships
Hey 14 year old, When adults say that these are the best years of your life, its not true. These are gonna be the hardest few years of your life. Keep your head up, it WILL get better. Sometimes, it gets 1000% better the second you graduate high school

Hey 16 year old, learn how to share your emotions with your friends, family, and crushes. Holding all those hormone-induced emotions in will only cause you pain. You won't always share them the right way -- forgive yourself and learn from those mistakes
Hey 51 year old, you've got kids that are growing into adulthood.  Be less of a 'helicopter parent', and one that supports what's in their head.  They may be thinking of college, career, etc.  Be less of a parent, and more of a mentor.  Food for thought
Hey 46 year old, If you have a family, try to work for a boss that also has a family. This is important for a few reasons. If your boss has a family, he / she will be more understanding about your home / life juggling act and the demands placed upon you
Hey 30 year old, By now you have probably failed at something. You have to pick yourself up and know that there are better things in store. Valuable lessons come from things that don’t work. Get back on the damn horse already and try something different
Hey 16 year old, Don't seek the wrong type of praise from anyone in life. Some things matter for the rest of your life. Experimentation and insatiable curiosity is natural in young adulthood. However being mature means steering that energy towards goals
Hey 16 year old, Before you decide on college, really understand what it is you want out of it. I went to community college to get my AA and then spent another 3 years attending a state university. I wish I had taken the time to research and think first
Hey 18 year old, Figure out what you want one year from now. Where do you want to be? Who do you want to be? Then do absolutely everything in your power every day starting right then to make sure you're in that place. You'll be shocked how far you'll go
Hey 18 year old, This is not the last year of your life, take it easy. There is basically no reason or requirement for you to be very serious about anything. Just relax and enjoy  early adulthood, it's the shortest and most enjoyable period of your life
Hey 28 year old, baby is coming? This will change your and your relationship! And your past - your childhood will come to haunt you! Get rid of your childhood and your partners childhood issues. Yes, they still matter. Get professional help if necessary!
Hey 30 year old, Raise your rates for whatever work you're doing. You've been working for a bit, probably--you've earned a raise, and the cost of living has probably gone up too. If you get in the habit of adjusting up, it will come more easily each time
Hey 16 year old, If the special person you're interested in isn't interested in you, they're not all that special. Find someone who is interested in you and given them a chance. You may realize you actually like them. You may not. But please just move on
Hey 17 year old, you're parents are a BILLION times better than they seem right now. Their advice may be strict but they always have you in mind. If they are wrong, try to convince them remembering that. They can be your closest allies if you let them be
Hey 15 year old, I know many people get bullied around these years in high school. Don't back down from the bullies. Stand up. Stand up for yourself, stand up for others that are being bullied. Stand up for each other whether it's you, friends, or others
Hey 21 year old, If you haven't already, start an investment account for your retirement/future (ROTH IRA). I know it seems far away, but a simple $1,000 invested today in the S&P 500 can be worth $20,000 just 35 years later. Every $1 = $20 by retirement
Hey 19 year old, Take care of yourself. Notice which things sap away at your energy: a cluttered living space, a toxic friendship, a view of yourself that's more critical than understanding. It's healthy to take the time to change or give up these things
Hey 32 year old, a relationship is like an investment. If you only make a single contribution, it will have limited growth. Keep dating him or her and don't fall into the cycle of being too busy/too comfortable. Make regular contributions so it will grow
Hey 18 year old, Take your mental health seriously. (If you can afford a therapist, see one, even if you are doing well! They can help keep you in the best shape possible.) You have to live with yourself, so make sure it's the healthiest self you can have
Hey 16 year old, this is just a casual reminder that, whether you choose higher education or not, high school drama disappears really quick when you walk the stage. Try your hardest to make and secure friendships and don't sweat people that don't like you
Hey 14 year old, Even though you feel like your emotions don't matter, they do. Others indeed have problems that are maybe a bit more serious then yours. But that doesn't mean that yours are invalid! You'll only teach yourself to feel guilty when your sad
Hey 21 year old, Drinking is fun... I get it. I still drink. Over time you will realize... It's Quality over Quantity. A few glasses of Whiskey can be just as effective as a case of beer. Buy a cool decanter, cigars & enjoy it over time with your best bud
Hey 13 year old, Trust me, popularity doesn't matter. Keep your close friends, and stay happy and don't try to compete with the no good popular people. (They usually end up having bad jobs, and less popular people usually end up with really good jobs btw)
Hey 15 year old, It feels like your parents don't understand you at all. You're actually right, but it's not because they don't care. They're just ordinary people, swamped by work, and they don't understand depression. Maybe sit down and just talk to them
Hey 35 year old, if you tell yourself what you're feeling is just stress, or holiday blues, or vitamin deficiency, or hormonal imbalance, but the feeling doesn't go away, it might be depression, and it's ok to run that by a mental health professional. Now
Hey 17 year old, Learn one technical skill you are already good at, then learn communication and people skills! When you get into a real job, it's not your technical skills that really matter, it's your ability to communicate with unfamiliar personalities
Hey 22 year old, You don't have to get married. Even more so, if you think you should, don't do it for that reason. Do it because you can't stay away from them. Do it because your life feels a thousand times richer with them. Do it because they're the one
Hey 18 year old, Be prepared to see anything. Violence in American is tamed by tax money that pays police and coroners. I saw a woman literally explode when I was 18. She jumped off of a 20 story building and burst on the pavement. (www.rolandoroblero.com)
Hey 18 year old, Do whatever makes you happy, and do it lots. Don't waste time with fake people, instead surround yourself with friends that improve you. Spend time on/find your passion in life and always keep working at it. Find multiple sources of income
Hey 22 year old, take a deep breath, go for a long walk in the woods (or plant trees for a few months out west if you can), and realize that you can and should capitalize on your talents now, don't wait. get over your disappointment in the world and create
Hey 19 year old, Stop looking for validation in the eyes of someone who doesn't care. There are so many people that truly care about your well being. After years of wasting time on the wrong people, I finally found my true friends. You are loved and worthy
Hey 18 year old, This is where the adventure begins, love yourself, have confidence in yourself and be a good person to the people around you, help them and be honest with them. Make new experiences, learn new things that will prepare you for your twenties
Hey 30 year old, Remember that your 30's can be the best years of your life so be grateful and make the most of it.  Your parents are likely still healthy, you're done with school, your career is going in the right direction, and your body doesn't ache yet
Hey 15 year old, Take school seriously. Don't have it your first aim in your early years of high school to fit in with everyone else. Focus on building yourself as an individual and try and get excelent grades because in the future they can determine a lot
Hey 14 year old, a successful career is built upon maintaining an edge against your peers. The time to find this edge is now. Look around you for something that is difficult to learn and which people pay for and make learning it a big part of your life now
Hey 30 year old, There are huge time-advantages to saving and investing early... and here you are, 30, thinking it's "too late" since you haven't yet begin. Nope. Time is still just barely on your side... but if you wait much longer, it won't be. Start now
Hey 17 year old, get a head start with falling in love with exercise now. Find a sport you love and get used to being sweaty. If you're limited by cash/transport use YouTube workout videos at home first so you aren't afraid of looking like a novice in a gym
Hey 19 year old, Focus on being a likeable person with good social skills and a high number of quality relationships at least twice as much as you focus on grades and skills. Jobs come from relationships, not achievement, and life is all about people anyway
Hey 18 year old, college stuff is rough. Getting set to go, the mail, learning how to navigate all the resources. After your first semester it becomes second nature. Just get it over with once.
PS. Scholarship applications suck. Apply for your Uni's grants
Hey 30 year old, If you want kids, stop putting it off. Now is the time to decide. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to keep up with them. If your girlfriend/wife is roughly the same age, now is her best chance to conceive and have healthy children
Hey 30 year old, you know that relationship you have right now? Work on it! Be open and honest with her. Like really open and honest, about everything. Kinks, shame, sins, wishes, doubts, don't let it pile up until you are 40, or your relationship will fail
Hey 18 year old, you will have been advised before that it doesn't matter what others think of you. It doesn't matter what anybody thinks of you, but you're now entering the part of your life in which you can choose your peers. They should think well of you
Hey 35 year old, Take some time off once a year and go to the desert. Stay overnight and grab your first cup of coffee outside at dawn. Watch the world wake up and let your thoughts, ideas and feelings float free. It'll be a life-changing moment. Every time
Hey 23 year old, Your manager's promise that he'll handle all the phone calls and emails sounds great, but you should ask to take on some of it yourself. You absolutely need to know how to work with clients and partners, and you'd be better off learning now
Hey 28 year old, not every problem needs to or can be solved right now. Zoom out and look at what can be done now, and do that. You’ll see that one, present action will give you clarity on what to do next, but doing nothing when you can do something is silly
Hey 23 year old, start putting even a small sum of money in funds, like index funds or ETFs, with a long term outlook. Add more money every now and then, possibly every time you get your salary. Keep all earnings there, learn the wonders of compound interest
Hey 18 year old, Before you go to college, learn about sexual assault on campus, consent, and the signs of abusive relationships. You will deal with it more than you think--the first few weeks of the school year usually have the most cases. Learn how to help
Hey 38 year old, GO TO COLLEGE. Don’t wait, don’t take a year off, just GO. It will determine how the rest of your life goes. Also, start putting $5 a week into a savings account and don’t touch it, if you can afford to, when you file your taxes, put in $100
Hey 14 year old, When someone asks you out, and you say no, Just stick with it. Don't pity date people. Because when you do, they start to manipulate you; think you like them. All they care about is the title claiming you as theirs. Don't pity date, it sucks
Hey 71 year old, If you've not already, review your 'self-satisfaction' quotient.  At this point in life, you should be ready to accept all kinds of attitudes and characteristics about yourself that may have irritated or mystified you for years.  Be at peace
Hey 20 year old, Your college experience isn't what you had hoped it would be. Don't let these 4 years determine the rest of your life. You will meet more people, places and opportunities in the years following that will help you find your place in the world
Hey 20 year old, I was taught that credit cards are evil.  In reality they are only bad if misused.  Build your credit so you don't end up living in a house that's falling apart, like mine.  You will need at least three lines of credit to buy a house someday
Hey 18 year old, Hoping to an entrepreneur for a career as a working class kid is like hoping to be a superhero or a unicorn or something like that.  You’re going to have to get a wage job.  But beyond that, personal connections are more important than money
Hey 22 year old, Invest in yourself and your future. Go to graduate school or build something new. Industry is for people who trade their youth for a paycheck. There's no long term growth for jobs that will be automated: finance, engineers, radiologists, etc
Hey 15 year old, Your exam scores are not as important as your parents make them out to be. They're also not as unimportant as those Instagram quotes make them out to be. They'll determine which college you get into - which does impact your life to SOME level
Hey 20 year old, Spend the next decade exploring, understanding you and the world you live in. Save marriage for thirty or above once you have a well established career, sowed your wild oaks and have figured out how you want to live and the companion you need
Hey 16 year old, The next few years of your life is going to be pivotal. The divergence between the life you'll live and the live you could have had is dependent on whether you set goals and go on to achieve them. Don't float through life waiting for tomorrow
Hey 22 year old, As you start to make Real Career Decisions, you're going to get a lot of advice, some asked-for, some not. Listen and stay humble, but also evaluate whether the people giving you that advice are happy with their own careers--especially family
Hey 18 year old, You are probably starting to choose where (or if) you will complete your post-secondary education. Don't feel pressured to go the same route all your peers or family traditionally take. Take the time to figure out what is really right for you
Hey 44 year old, Please focus on your children. Take an interest in their interests, talk to them, hug them, tell them you love them. They grow too fast and your time with them will run out. If you don’t cherish them, it WILL be the biggest regret of your life
Hey 25 year old, the next 5 years of your life will determine the setup of the next decade. Stop risk-taking and instead professionalise. Become financially secure before it is expected from you. Learn how to operate with the charm of the best in your business
Hey 20 year old, Your current Uni course isn't working for you. Instead of hitting your head against the wall, just go to your advisor and ask how to change it. You will save yourself so much grief. (Also, pay attention in Stats. You'll need it later in life!)
Hey 13 year old, That moustache has to go. You need to make your mom aware of the impact it has on your social life and your confidence. It's just a first shave, you're not leaving the house just yet, but momma's boy is growing and she needs to understand that

Hey 21 year old, Take advantage of compound interest. Save as early as you can. 
Saving $150 a month for 40 years vs waiting, then saving $200 a month for 30 yrs. Both examples contribute 72K. The 40 yr saver has over 520k vs less than 300k for the 30 yr saver
Hey 13 year old, Don't worry so much about what other think of you. Watch those shows that everyone else think's are cringey, keep making cringey fan-art, keep being you. Most people are too concerned with how other people think of them to be concerned with you
Hey 20 year old, This is all such a bunch of gormless vapid chicken-soup-for-the-soul bullshit. One gets the sense that none of the people giving advice have ever faced real hardship. When the moment comes that you have to make a real choice, think for yourself
Hey 19 year old, Get away from your friends for a few weeks after highschool. You will realize who is real and who enabled you for years. Be yourself. Respect other. Respect/love yourself for who you are. Because in the end alot of your "best friends" disappear
Hey 18 year old, If in your first year as an adult you're still surrounded by cliques that make you feel like you're somehow less valuable than they are, these are incredibly petty people you can walk away from. You can start over now. Please meet better people
Hey 19 year old, Cursing can be a great emotional release, but if you're going to curse, learn to do it properly and efficiently. Dropping F-bombs every other word doesn't help get your point across. Peppering your speech with well-placed profanities is the key
Hey 24 year old, If you had a past of abuse you should consider how you may be seeing the world through a distorted lens. I am realizing now that growing up with a negative perception of others and of myself has had a severe impact on how I function in the world

Hey 17 year old, Feeling mopey about not meeting "the one"? Stop it!  There is a lot more life coming up and you are still young.  The best thing you can do right now is focus on your passions and your friends/family.  The complications of companionship can wait
Hey 25 year old, Have sex and also make LOVE.  You are in your prime. Don't tie yourself down with the hometown guy/girl or the one you met on that app.  Find what you like.  Disregard race and age and have fun.   Find the one you still want to bang when your 80
Hey 22 year old, you only want to do a PhD because you're afraid of leaving education. A PhD is not just like three or four more years of Uni. You will need more self discipline than you're capable of. Just go find a nice steady job instead, and do the PhD later
Hey 18 year old, Go to college and finish in 4-5 years. There will be temptations to take a semester off, travel, follow a significant other, etc. Resist them. You will be 22-23 when you graduate, which is still so unbelievably young, but you don't know that yet
Hey 38 year old, Whenever you think about buying something extravagant, consider how much use you'll REALLY get out of it. Be honest. Ask yourself if there's a cheaper alternative you'll get the same use out of. You'll love having the money to handle emergencies
Hey 23 year old, yes, you’re young, but very quickly you won’t be. Start planning some realistic goals and expectations for yourself. Start moving towards them now. Even if you change your mind, you’ll be miles ahead of others and can pivot your focus. Start now
Hey 27 year old, If you're feeling unsatisfied with the relationship you've been in since your early 20s, don't let the scariness of trying something new stop you. You will find a much deeper connection with someone at this age than you did in your college years

Hey 15 year old, Get into computers. And I don't mean learn how to use Microsoft Word or something, I mean learn to code. Start simple like writing quizzes in C or crappy little websites in HTML. Start now. The future is always software and technology in general
Hey 22 year old, Not sure what you want to do when you “grow up”? Just move toward what you are interested in at the moment. What you are interested in right now is what you should do. Don’t worry about 30 years down the road. What do you like right now? Do that
Hey 16 year old, Don't worry too much about your future. You're still so, so young. Do what makes you happy and see where life takes you. Very few people in their mid-twenties are doing exactly what they wanted to when they were your age, but they're still happy
Hey 30 year old, You're not too late to start learning something new. We can always grow to be better at anything. Talent just measures how easy it is for something new to stick but without effort, talent doesn't generate skill. And success is skill times effort
